     - Add a new column by navigating to Add Column > Date > Month Name.
   
   - Revenue Generated per Sale: To calculate the total revenue per sale:
      Add a custom column with the following DAX expression:
       Revenue = [Price Per Unit] * [Units Sold]
     - Close and apply the changes in Power Query.

 4.Building Visualizations
   - **Title the Dashboard
     - Insert a **Rectangle shape**: Format it with a title "Sales Dashboard".
     - Resize, apply colors, and adjust the font to **Bold** with font size **39** and margin **15px**.

 5. Creating Key Visualizations

     - Use the Card visualization to display key metrics such as:
       - Total revenue generated from the sales
       - Total units sold
       - Average price per unit
     - Format these cards by adjusting the alignment, colors, and decimal precision for clean, easy-to-read visuals.

   - Revenue by Month:
     - Use a Stacked Column Chart to visualize revenue by month:
       - Select the Month Name and Revenue fields.
       - Sort the data by Month Name to ensure proper chronological order by going to Table View > Sort by Column > Month Name.
   
   - Revenue by State:
     - Use a Map visualization to show revenue generated by each state:
       - Select the Revenue and State fields.
       - Format the map to adjust the bubble size (for visualizing states with higher sales) and enable zoom-in and zoom-out buttons for detailed exploration.

   - Individual Pop Sales:
     - Use a Slicer to filter and display individual beverage sales:
       - Set the slicer to select the Beverage Brand Name.
       - In Slicer Settings, set it to a List and remove the background for a cleaner look.
